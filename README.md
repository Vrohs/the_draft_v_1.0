🎬 The Draft — Write. Shape. Ship.
A writer-first screenwriting workspace that helps storytellers move from idea to camera-ready draft with speed, clarity, and creative control.

The Draft is made for people who write: screenwriters, playwrights, showrunners, and creative teams who want an intuitive, distraction-free editor plus the tools to plan, collaborate, and deliver polished scripts — without wrestling with layout or feature bloat.

Why The Draft?
Built around writing flow, not menus — type naturally and let the editor handle formatting.
Organize ideas visually — outlines, index cards, and scene management live alongside your draft.
Collaboration that respects craft — live co-writing, threaded notes, and transparent revision history.
Production-ready exports — industry-standard formats for submissions, table reads, and production.
Mobile-friendly and focused — write anytime, anywhere, with an interface that gets out of your way.
What it does for you
Removes friction in early drafting so you reach workable pages faster.
Makes collaboration productive: see who changed what, leave precise feedback, and resolve notes without losing context.
Preserves experimentation: named drafts, snapshots, and diff views let you try ideas without fear.
Helps you prep for production: scene breakdowns, character and location sheets, and clean export-ready scripts.

The Draft experience — plain and simple
Open the editor and start writing. The Draft recognizes scene headings and dialogue as you type, so you never think about margins or layout. Build an outline with visual cards you can reorder, then jump straight to any scene. Invite collaborators, track suggestions as named drafts, compare versions side-by-side, and when it’s ready, export a submission-grade PDF or an .fdx file for the reading table.
