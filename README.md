🎬 The Draft — Write. Shape. Ship.
A writer-first screenwriting workspace that helps storytellers move from idea to camera-ready draft with speed, clarity, and creative control.

The Draft is built for people who write: screenwriters, playwrights, showrunners, and creative teams who want an intuitive, distraction-free editor plus the tools to plan, collaborate, and deliver polished scripts — without wrestling with layout or feature bloat.

Why The Draft?
Designed around writing flow, not menus. Type naturally and let the editor do the formatting.
Keeps ideas organized: outlines, index cards, and scene management live alongside your draft.
Collaboration that respects the craft: live co-writing, threaded notes, and clear revision history.
Export when you’re ready: industry-standard formats for production, tables reads, and submissions.
Mobile-friendly and focused — write anytime, anywhere, with an interface that gets out of your way.
What it does for you
Speeds up early drafting by removing friction and interruptions.
Makes collaboration productive: see who changed what, leave precise feedback, and resolve notes without losing context.
Preserves your creative process: named drafts, snapshots, and diff views mean you can experiment safely.
Helps you prep for production: scene breakdowns, character & location sheets, and export-ready scripts.

Who it's for

The Draft experience (in plain terms)
Open the editor and the interface guides you — it recognizes scene headings and dialogue as you type, so you never have to think about margins or layout. Build an outline with cards you can reorder, then jump back into the draft at any scene. Invite a collaborator; track suggestions as named drafts and compare two versions side by side. When it’s ready, export a submission-grade PDF or an .fdx file for the reading table.
